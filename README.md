# SITLdataProcessing
Data processing template created for my master thesis purposes.


This code is a tool used for data analysis part of master thesis titled "Simulation-based autopilot tuning for fixed-wing UAVs. From modeling to experimental validation.", authors: Cezar-Victor Boruga and Natalia Zalewska.

Data comes from Ardupilog files. To enable code working (convert .log files to Matlab Datatables), it is essential to utilize Matlab's Ardupilog function:

Most of the included functions are used in the main code. Some of them are additonal, as they could be useful depending on authors' needs.
